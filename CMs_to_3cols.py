""" matrices_to_3cols.py

    Reads in a directory of code matrices (CMs). Outputs a directory of "3cols,"
    which are 2D arrays, each arranged in three columns, thusly:

    from    to   value

    where "from" and "to" are codes, and "value" is the number of edges in the
    originating set of SSMs that go from "from" to "to." In each 3col file
    output there is a row for each element in its corresponding CM.

    Usage:
        CMs_to_3cols.py cm_dir output_dir

    Args:
        cm_dir: A directory of Code Matrix (CM) files.
        output_dir: A directory (required to exist) that is the intended target
            location for a set of "3col" files.

    Requires that the files in the two directories follow these naming
    conventions:
        CM file: "<name>-CM.csv"
        3col file: "<name>-3col.csv"
