    Usage:
        create_code_matrices.py cblm_dir code_matrix_dir

    Args:
        cblm_dir: A directory of Coded Binary Link Matrix (CBLM) files.
        code_matrix_dir: A directory (required to exist) where a set of Code
            Matrix (CM) files is going to be put.

    Requires that the files in the two directories follow these naming
    conventions:
        CBLM file: "<name>-CBLM.csv"
        CM file: "<name>-CM.csv"
    where <name> is a string that may or may not be constructed according to a
